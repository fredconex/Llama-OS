This is an application I'm developing, the idea is to create a small system around llama.cpp tools but without need to hook with the dll files.

- [x] Model management
- [x] HuggingFace Integration
- [x] Llama.cpp GitHub Integration with releases management
- [x] Llama-server terminal launching with easy arguments customization, Internal / External
- [x] Simple chat interface for easy testing
- [x] Hardware monitor
- [x] Color themes

# To-do (long way ahead)
- [ ] Cleanup code and organize it better
- [ ] Add option to group files by model / quantization / architecture
- [ ] Improve chat organization with model tagging and ability to rename the chat
- [ ] Tools (MCP) compatibility
- [ ] RAG implementation
- [ ] Make compatible with Linux and Mac

# Building
Use ```cargo tauri build```, it will output to ```backend\target\release```.
